Description: This is a package designed for easly compute a phylogeny with the
    concatenated alignemnt of a set of pre-computed Hidden Markov Models hits. 
    It uses HMMER 3.1b2 as search engine, MAFFT as aligner, and PHANGORN 
    package as phylogeny inference software. It also provides a couple of 
    functions to download specific sets of curated HMMs from the EggNOG 
    database in order to allow the identification of "core" genes and build the
    alignment and phylogeny with them.
